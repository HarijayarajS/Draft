Got it ✅ — you want a **complete seminar-style guide** to explain **Rust `struct`** in depth.
I’ll prepare it like **lecture notes**: structured, with examples, and covering **all important features**.

# 📖 Complete Guide to `struct` in Rust

## 1. 🔹 Introduction to `struct`

* A **`struct` (structure)** is a custom data type that lets you group related values into one unit.
* Similar to a class without methods in OOP.
* Useful for modeling **real-world entities**.

👉 Example:

```rust
struct User {
    username: String,
    email: String,
    active: bool,
    sign_in_count: u64,
}
```

---

## 2. 🔹 Creating & Using Structs

* **Initialization**:

```rust
let user1 = User {
    username: String::from("hari"),
    email: String::from("hari@example.com"),
    active: true,
    sign_in_count: 1,
};
```

* **Access fields**:

```rust
println!("Username: {}", user1.username);
```

* **Mutability**:

```rust
let mut user2 = user1;
user2.email = String::from("new@example.com");
```

---

## 3. 🔹 Struct Update Syntax

* Create a new struct from an existing one using `..`

```rust
let user2 = User {
    email: String::from("test@example.com"),
    ..user1
};
```

⚠️ Moves non-`Copy` fields (like `String`).

---

## 4. 🔹 Tuple Structs

* Structs **without named fields**.

```rust
struct Color(i32, i32, i32);
let black = Color(0, 0, 0);
println!("Red: {}", black.0);
```

Useful for simple wrappers.

---

## 5. 🔹 Unit-like Structs

* Structs with **no fields**.

```rust
struct Marker;
let _m = Marker;
```

Useful for **traits** when you just need a type.

---

## 6. 🔹 Methods & Associated Functions (`impl`)

* Structs can have methods via `impl`.

```rust
impl User {
    fn is_active(&self) -> bool {
        self.active
    }

    fn new(username: String, email: String) -> Self {
        Self {
            username,
            email,
            active: true,
            sign_in_count: 0,
        }
    }
}
```

* Call:

```rust
let user = User::new("hari".into(), "hari@example.com".into());
println!("Active: {}", user.is_active());
```

---

## 7. 🔹 Structs and Ownership

* Struct fields follow **ownership & borrowing rules**.

```rust
struct Book {
    title: String,
}

fn main() {
    let book1 = Book { title: String::from("Rust Book") };
    let book2 = book1; // moves title
    // println!("{}", book1.title); ❌ error
}
```

* Borrow with references:

```rust
struct Book<'a> {
    title: &'a str,
}
```

---

## 8. 🔹 Traits with Structs

* Implement traits for structs.

```rust
use std::fmt;

impl fmt::Display for User {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter) -> fmt::Result {
        write!(f, "{} <{}>", self.username, self.email)
    }
}
```

Now you can:

```rust
println!("{}", user);
```

---

## 9. 🔹 Derivable Traits

* Common traits auto-implemented with `#[derive]`.

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq)]
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}
```

* Use `{:?}` or `{:#?}` for pretty debug print.

---

## 10. 🔹 Generic Structs

* Structs can be **generic**.

```rust
struct Pair<T> {
    first: T,
    second: T,
}

let pair = Pair { first: 1, second: 2 };
```

* With trait bounds:

```rust
struct Point<T: Copy> {
    x: T,
    y: T,
}
```

---

## 11. 🔹 Structs with Lifetimes

* Needed when struct holds **references**.

```rust
struct Message<'a> {
    content: &'a str,
}

fn main() {
    let text = String::from("Hello");
    let msg = Message { content: &text };
    println!("{}", msg.content);
}
```

---

## 12. 🔹 Nested Structs

```rust
struct Address {
    city: String,
    zip: u32,
}

struct Person {
    name: String,
    address: Address,
}
```

---

## 13. 🔹 Pattern Matching with Structs

```rust
let user = User::new("hari".into(), "hari@example.com".into());

let User { username, email, .. } = user;
println!("{} {}", username, email);
```

---

## 14. 🔹 Advanced Features

* **Destructuring in functions**:

```rust
fn print_user(User { username, email, .. }: &User) {
    println!("{} <{}>", username, email);
}
```

* **Struct update in builders** (`builder pattern`)

```rust
struct Config {
    host: String,
    port: u16,
}

impl Config {
    fn new() -> Self {
        Self { host: "localhost".into(), port: 8080 }
    }

    fn port(mut self, port: u16) -> Self {
        self.port = port;
        self
    }
}
```

---

## 15. 🔹 Real-world Examples

* **CLI config**:

```rust
struct CliArgs {
    verbose: bool,
    file: String,
}
```

* **Web backend model**:

```rust
#[derive(sqlx::FromRow)]
struct User {
    id: i32,
    username: String,
    email: String,
}
```

# 🎤 Seminar Flow (How to Present)

1. Start with **what a struct is** (compare to classes in OOP).
2. Explain **basic struct syntax** with fields.
3. Show **tuple & unit-like structs** (lightweight use cases).
4. Move to **methods & `impl` blocks**.
5. Dive into **ownership, borrowing, lifetimes** in structs.
6. Add **traits, derives, generics**.
7. End with **real-world examples** (CLI args, DB models).
