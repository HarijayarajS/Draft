Of course. Here is the API guide for managing Privileges, following the professional format you provided.
API Guide: Privilege Management
This guide provides technical specifications for managing Privileges within the Enzo POS Access Control List (ACL) system. A Privilege represents the most granular, individual permission that can be assigned to a role. It defines a single action a user is allowed to perform, such as creating a product or deleting a staff member.
Managing these privileges is a core part of configuring the system's security and user capabilities. The typical workflow involves creating all necessary atomic permissions, which are then organized into groups and assigned to roles.
Base URL: https://api.enzo-pos.com/v1
Authentication: All endpoints require a Bearer <accessToken> in the Authorization header.

| title | String | A short, human-readable name (e.g., "Can create products"). | Required |
| description | String | A more detailed explanation of what the privilege allows. | Optional |
| identifier | String | A unique string identifier, often a kebab-case version of the code. | Required, Unique |
